### What is this repository for? ###

* Quick summary
HOAMR (High-Order Adaptive Mesh Refinement) is a compressible Navier-Stokes/Euler solver with the Adaptive Mesh Refinement technique. The parallelization of the code and all the construction, management and storage of cells are facilitated by the SAMRAI(Structured Adaptive Mesh Refinement Application Infrastructure) library from the Lawrence Livermore National Lab. The code consists of several high-order shock-capturing schemes for simulating shock waves, material interfaces, and turbulent features.
